# üó∫Ô∏è Luxembourg Map Shortest Path Calculator

## Overview
This Java project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) featuring a map of Luxembourg. Users can interact with the map by selecting two points using mouse clicks, and the application calculates the shortest path between these points using the Dijkstra algorithm. Additionally, the project includes comprehensive testing using JUnit 5 to ensure the correctness of pathfinding algorithms and application functionalities.

## Features
### 1. **Interactive Map**
   - **Graphical Display:** Displays a map of Luxembourg within the application window.
   - **Clickable Interface:** Users can click on different locations to select points of interest.

### 2. **Shortest Path Calculation**
   - **Dijkstra Algorithm:** Computes the shortest path between two selected points.

### 3. **User Interaction**
   - **Point Selection:** Allows users to pick starting and destination points by clicking on the map.
   - **Visualization:** Shows the selected points and the calculated shortest path on the map.

### 4. **Testing with JUnit 5**
   - **Unit Tests:** Includes comprehensive JUnit 5 tests to validate pathfinding algorithms and application functionalities.
   - **Integration Tests:** Ensures the correctness of user interactions and GUI behaviors.

## Technologies
- **Java:** Core programming language for application development.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Java Swing for creating the interactive map interface.
- **Dijkstra Algorithm:** Implements graph traversal and shortest path calculation.
- **Mapping Data:** Utilizes Luxembourg map data for graphical representation and pathfinding calculations.
- **JUnit 5:** Framework for writing and running tests to ensure application reliability and correctness.
